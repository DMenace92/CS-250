Module 8 Journal 
•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-	The Game room client is a single to multiplayer game that will be offered on multiple platforms windows, apple, and mobile devises. Base on the 1980s television game win, lose or draw, are client creative technology solution provided the idea and information regarding the development of this project. The type of software creative technology want designed is the game platform to be accessible on the internet.   

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-	Working on computers and having a great interest in the hardware components of a computer gave me an advantage in creating the developing documents. Having the experience of both owning and working on the different platforms due to my curiosity gave me the tools required for this assignment.  

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-	Having the design documents provided the direction that was very help full for completing and developing the program for the client creative technology solutions. Creating a program with out well written documentation and directions will lead to a product that side tract to a product that was not agreed upon by the client.  


•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-	The part I would revise on the document is the storage management. Having completed the document, I believe I could have entered more information on how the program will exist on the root tree on the machine. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-	Working on a user-based program it is important to implement a platform that allows the program to be accessible in different locations the user might be if possible. Having the game posted on the internet it is important for the user to have access to a network. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
-	The approaches I have made on developing software is going over the clients’ transcripts on the requirements of the program and key features. Creating flowcharts creating a structure of the functions and methods required for the application functionality. After creating the flow chart creating Pseudocode of the program will benefit the logic forming of the program
