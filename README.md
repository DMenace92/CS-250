Module Journal 8

•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 

- Incorporating the needs of a program is the number one priority. Implementing agile to the project flow will benefit the progression of the program’s development. With agile the method used to fulfill the clients demands are by having the project owner set up a meeting with the client and create a transcript story with key features that will pertain to the product. 

•	How does creating “user stories” help with this?

- Splitting and identifying different features of the program by priority ensures that the most important is completed first then working on the lower priority. As to the user stories for large project the grope can focus on one portion of the build while having a set timeline and group while having scrum meetings. For example, the assignments on modules 2-4 we worked on entering information of features for the SNHU travel site using the excel spreadsheet. Entering the features for the travel site by questioning the users and shareholders we can expand further and form better understanding during the developing phase of the project. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? 

- Working as developer on the project we are guided and informed on the requirements and information provided by the scrum master. Working as a developer taking the information from the scrum stories questions create a flow chart along with pseudocode. 

•	What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- In the future working on personal and professional development learning and applying agile is a benefit for time management. Incorporating agile methodology for instance scrum meeting scrum stories sprints and rolling wave planning 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

-Working in a team developing a product the most important trait to have been being a great communicator. Working on a task individually rolling out information to the other members efficiently benefits the process of the development. Having a voice to identify issues or ideas are key features of an active member. The second trait for an ideal member of the team is resourcefulness. With the agile methodology the project may be able to shift as it is accepted by agile methodology flow having the skill of finding solutions is crucial.
